# Clock Program

That's a simple web clock program, by which it's possible to know date and time. I've done some simple art representing the current part of day (morning, afternoon, evening and night) on background, as well as a greeting. It's made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Contributing

Anyone can contribute to it with issues and pull requests, even thought there's not much features to add (it's just a clock with some style).
