# Clock Program

That's a simple executable clock program, by which it's possible to know date and time. I've done some simple art representing the current part of day (morning, afternoon, evening and night) on background, as well as a greeting. It's made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and built as <italic>.exe</italic> with ElectronJS.

## Contributing

Anyone can contribute to it with issues and pull requests, even thought there's not much features to add (it's just a clock with some style).

## Installation

The <italic>.exe</italic> and <italic>.msi</italic> files are available in the repository.
